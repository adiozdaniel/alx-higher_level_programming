## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random signed ```number``` to the variable ```number``` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable ```number``` is positive or negative.

* You can find the original source code [```here```](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/e4tR3cjFHqhelf4y485-zQ)
* The variable ```number``` will store a different value every time you will run this program
* This code is untouched ```import, random. randint```
* The output of the program is:
  * The number, followed by
    * if the number is greater than 0: ```is positive```
    * if the number is 0: ```is zero```
    * if the number is less than 0: ```is negative```
  * followed by a new line

```py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-4 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
0 is zero
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-3 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-10 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
10 is positive
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-5 is negative

```

### 1. The last digit

This program will assign a random signed ```number``` to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable ```number```.

* You can find the original source code [```here```](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Vku0ZPFeDPuXUKD8nZ4mOQ)
* The variable ```number``` will store a different value every time you will run this program
* **Please do not touch this code**... ```import, random.randint``` do.  This line should not change: ```number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)```
* The output of the program is:
  * The string ```Last digit of,``` followed by
  * the number, followed by
  * the string ```is```, followed by the last digit of ```number```, followed by
    * if the last digit is greater than 5: the string ```and is greater than 5```
    * if the last digit is 0: the string ```and is 0```
    * if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string ```and is less than 6 and not 0```
